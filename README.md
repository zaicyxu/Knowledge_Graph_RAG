# Traceability Analysis of LLM and Prolog

## Current Issues

#### Issues from the LLM Sides

1. The Final Answer from LLM is not stable yet. For example, the LLM make final answers, sometimes not regarding the following prompts somtimes contain t.

	- Which kind of algorithm has been used in Autonomous braking system?
	- What kind of functionalities containing this system?
	- Which sensor is most related to the pedestrian detection?

#### Issues from the Orchestrator Sides

1. Unify the name between LLM and Prolog.

â€‹	e.g., mono_camera and Mono Camera.
