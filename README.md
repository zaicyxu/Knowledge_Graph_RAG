# Traceability Analysis of LLM and Prolog

## Current Issues

#### Issues from the LLM Sides

1. The Final Answer from LLM is not stable yet. For example, regarding the following prompts, the LLM sometimes make final answers  somtimes nor.

	- Which kind of algorithm has been used in Autonomous braking system?
	- What kind of functionalities containing this system?
	- Which sensor is most related to the pedestrian detection?

#### Issues from the Orchestrator Sides

1. Unify the name between LLM and Prolog.

â€‹	e.g., mono_camera and Mono Camera.
